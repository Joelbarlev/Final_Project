With Bash we built a database in SQL and a Python server (with Flask) to answer queries:
Average price by city and year
Price trends over time
Price comparison by store type

The second part of the assignment involves coding a script for the popular word game, Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 

The task requires parsing user input, processing it according to game rules, and generating valid word combinations based on the provided criteria. It's a blend of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, focusing on string manipulation and logic implementation. This segment provides an opportunity for creative problem-solving while honing skills in algorithm development and game mechanics understanding.
